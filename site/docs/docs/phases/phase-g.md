# Phase G: Intersection

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Reward** | +492 |
| **Status** | IN PROGRESS |
| **Steps** | 5M |
| **Observations** | 242D |
| **Tags** | PPO, T/Cross/Y Junction, Turn Decision |

## Overview

Most complex phase with T-intersections, cross-roads, and Y-junctions. Agent must learn turn decisions, right-of-way, and intersection navigation.

## Challenges

- Fundamentally different from highway driving
- Turn decision requires new policy patterns
- Right-of-way rules are complex
- Lower reward (+492) reflects dramatically increased complexity

## Key Insight

Intersection navigation requires fundamentally different policy from highway driving. Turn decision observation space and reward shaping still being refined.
