                     PHASE A ANALYSIS - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
================================================================================

VERDICT: SUCCESS (Grade A)

FINAL METRICS:
  Mean Reward:          2113.75    (target: 900)        PASS [+135%]
  Collision Rate:       0%         (target: <5%)        PASS [PERFECT]
  Goal Completion:      100%       (target: >85%)       PASS [PERFECT]
  Speed Tracking:       89.9%      (target: 85-90%)     PASS [EXCELLENT]
  Training Steps:       2.5M       (68% fewer than Phase 0)

CURRICULUM COMPLETION: 3/3 Stages
  Stage 1 (1-2 NPCs):      Foundation building - SUCCESS
  Stage 2 (3-4 NPCs):      Peak performance (3161 reward) - SUCCESS
  Stage 3 (5-6 NPCs):      Dense adaptation (2491 reward) - SUCCESS

PHASE 0 COMPARISON:
  Peak Reward:          +191%      (1086 -> 3161)
  Final Reward:         +107%      (1018 -> 2114)
  Safety:               IMPROVED   (2% -> 0% collision)
  Training Speed:       68% FASTER (8M -> 2.5M steps)

REWARD BREAKDOWN:
  Speed Reward:         1985.30/ep (93.9% of total)
  Progress Reward:      284.91/ep  (13.5% of total)
  Overtaking Bonus:     0/ep       (0% - NOT TRIGGERED)

SAFETY RECORD:
  Collisions:           0/238 episodes
  Off-Road:             0 events
  Goal Success:         238/238 episodes
  Stuck:                0 events

CRITICAL FINDINGS:
  1. Overtaking: 0 detected events (unvalidated, needs Phase B investigation)
  2. Stage 3 Reward: -21% from peak (agent adapted to 5-6 NPCs, 0% collision)
  3. Training Stability: Excellent convergence by 2M steps, no instability

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PHASE B:
  HIGH: Validate overtaking behavior (currently unvalidated)
  HIGH: Analyze Stage 3 performance context
  MEDIUM: Implement safety limits on episode length

MODEL SELECTION:
  Path:    results/phase-A-overtaking/E2EDrivingAgent-2500155
  Format:  ONNX (2.5MB) + PyTorch (.pt)
  Status:  READY FOR PHASE B
