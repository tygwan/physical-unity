| Run ID | Description | Failure Reason |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| v12_HybridPolicy | Hybrid action space (discrete+continuous) | Policy complexity issues |

## Learnings

1. **Hybrid Policies**: Mixing discrete and continuous actions requires careful tuning
2. **Curriculum Complexity**: Too many curriculum stages can cause training instability
3. **Reward Shaping**: Overly complex reward functions lead to unintended behaviors
